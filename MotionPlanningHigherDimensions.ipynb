    "dimensionality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the combinatorial explosion in the number of grid cells needed\n",
    "to span a space, there are several other odd effects in high dimensional\n",
    "spaces that are counterintuitive to our experience in 2D and 3D spaces.\n",

    "reasonable definitions of \"far\". Another effect is that the complexity\n",
    "of a polytope grows dramatically. Consider a polytope in $d$-D space\n",
    "with $n$ faces, such as that defined by a linear equality $A x \\leq b$,\n",
    "with $A$ an $n \\times d$ matrix and $b$ an $n$-vector. The number of\n",

    "The average time needed for incremental PRM to solve a given problem\n",

    "essential, since thousands or millions of queries will be made during a\n",
    "\"reasonably\" sized run $(N=$1,000 to 100,000, usually). Second, the\n",
    "nearness criterion (either number of neighbors $k$ or radius $R$) should\n",
    "be set so that a small number of edges are checked, but not too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path quality of PRM solutions can be quite variable. If there exists\n",
    "a suboptimal wide passage in $\\mathcal{F}$ while the optimal passage is\n",
    "narrow, incremental PRM will find the suboptimal one first (with very\n",
    "high likelihood). Basic PRM will find the suboptimal one when $N$ is\n",
    "low, but does have a chance to find the optimal one once $N$ is large\n",
    "enough. There is also an issue of jerkiness of the produced path, which\n",

    "#### Nonuniform sampling strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Since PRM and RRT performance depends highly on how well samples are\n",

    "boost performance with nonuniform sampling. PRMs benefit from placing\n",

    "$n_i[q]$, respectively, for each $q\\in V$). After $N$ samples, more\n",
    "samples are added near the milestones with a large fraction of\n",
    "infeasible edges, with the hope that these milestones are located in\n",
    "low-visibility regions where a denser sampling is needed to make\n",
    "connections. Specifically, we might pick a milestone $q \\in V$ with\n",
    "probability proportional to $n_i[q] / (n_i[q] + n_f[q])$ and then sample\n",
    "a new configuration from a disk centered at $q$ with radius $R$. If\n",
    "feasible, the new milestone is connected to the roadmap as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method that can boost PRM performance in low-visibility spaces\n",
    "is the Gaussian sampling strategy. The idea is to increase the density\n",
    "of milestones near the boundaries of obstacles, since low-visibility\n",
    "regions will certainly be located near obstacles. The method actually\n",
    "draws two samples: one $q_1$ at random, and the second $q_2$ from a\n",
    "multivariate Gaussian distribution (see\n",
    "[Appendix A.3.](Probability.ipynb#Multivariate-Gaussians)) centered at $q_1$ and with\n",
    "standard deviation $\\sigma$. Then, *only if exactly one of the samples\n",

    "ensures that the segment between $q_1$ and $q_2$ straddles the boundary\n",
    "between the free space and forbidden region.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might seem odd to throw away perfectly good feasible samples, since\n",
    "adding them to the roadmap won't hurt (and can only help) connectivity.\n",
    "However, every additional milestone incurs additional work to test and\n",
    "connect edges. In fact, edge collision checking is often the dominant\n",
    "cost of planning. It turns out that in the presence of narrow passages,\n",
    "the added cost to generate samples is worth it, and Gaussian sampling\n",
    "can perform quite well. However, for best performance the perturbation\n",
    "standard deviation $\\sigma$ must be tuned to trade off these competing\n",

If we can show that $d(a,b) \\leq c(a)+c(b)$, then we can be certain that $\\overline{ab}$ is collision free.

Hence, $$\\eta_1(q,q^\\prime) = L_1 |q_1 - q^\\prime_1 |$$ is a suitable upper bound.  Through similar reasoning, we can show that $$\\eta_2(q,q^\\prime) = (L_1+L_2) (|q_1 - q^\\prime_1 | + |q_2 - q^\\prime_2 |)$$ is an upper bound on how far the tip of link 2 moves.  There are general formulas like this for arbitrary articulated robots.  Specifically, $$\\eta_k(q,q^\\prime) = (R_k + \\sum_i^{k-1} L_i) \\| (q_1,\\ldots,q_k) - (q^\\prime_1,\\ldots,q_k^\\prime)\\|_1$$ is a suitable function for all nR robots. \n",

    "paths quickly when they do work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential fields are a well-studied technique that works using only\n",
    "local information to guide the robot's movement, and is therefore quite\n",
    "fast, making it appropriate for real-time obstacle avoidance as well as\n",
    "path planning in relatively simple spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to consider the robot's configuration as being a\n",
    "particle in some energy potential landscape. Due to \"gravity\" the\n",
    "particle will feel some virtual forces equal to the negative of the\n",
    "gradient of this landscape. If the landscape is constructed to have a\n",
    "global minimum at the goal, then by following the gradient the particle\n",
    "will, hopefully, arrive at the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct such a landscape, the usual method is to combine an\n",
    "*attractive potential* field in which the force is some gain constant\n",
    "$k_{att}$ times the vector pointing direction to the goal:\n",
    "$$P_{att}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{att} \\| q - q_g \\|^2$$ along with a\n",
    "*repulsive potential* generating a repulsive force for each obstacle.\n",
    "The repulsive force is chosen to grow larger (typically toward infinity)\n",
    "as the robot gets closer to the obstacle. Some limiting distance\n",
    "$\\rho_0$ is typically chosen where the effect of an obstacle drops off\n",
    "to 0. One such function is the following:\n",
    "$$P_{rep}(q) = \\left\\lbrace \\begin{array}{ll} \n",
    "\\frac{1}{2}k_{rep}(1/\\rho(q) - 1/\\rho_0)^2  &  \\text{If }\\rho(q) \\leq \\rho_0\\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{If }\\rho(q) > \\rho_0\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right.$$ Here $\\rho(q)$ is a function that measures the\n",
    "workspace distance between the robot and the obstacle, and $k_{rep}$\n",
    "modulates the strength of the force. The potential is infinity at\n",
    "$\\rho(q)=0$ and drops down to 0 at $\\rho(q) = \\rho_0$. (Note that here\n",
    "we must be able to calculate distance rather than just Boolean collision\n",
    "detection.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The force acting on the particle is the negated gradient of each\n",
    "potential: $$f_{att}(q) = -k_{att} (q - q_g)$$ and\n",
    "$$f_{rep}(q) = \\left\\lbrace \\begin{array}{ll} \n",

    "Then, to evolve the configuration over time as a particle in this\n",

    "by: $$q_{t+1} = q_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{m}(f_{att}(q) + f_{rep}(q))$$\n",
    "where $m$ is a virtual \"mass\" of the robot and $\\Delta t$ is the time\n",

    "the boundary of an obstacle. To avoid huge jumps (or little movement at\n",
    "all) in the path it makes sense to dynamically set the mass to be\n",

    "### Trajectory optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Trajectory optimization is another potential-based method that optimizes\n",
    "the overall shape of the robot's path to minimize cost. Unlike potential\n",
    "fields, for which the optimization variable is the configuration of a\n",
    "single point in time, trajectory optimization uses some parameterization\n",
    "of the *entire* path as the optimization variable. This helps it avoid\n",
    "future obstacles and, in some cases, avoid local minima that potential\n",
    "fields would fall prey to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such methods begins with the definition of some fixed number of *path\n",
    "parameters* $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ which dictate the shape of a\n",
    "candidate path. One example, for piecewise linear paths passing between\n",
    "the start and the goal configuration, is simply the set of intermediate\n",
    "milestones: $$\\theta = (q_1,\\ldots,q_{k-1})$$ In this case, the path\n",
    "$y(s)$ consists of $k$ straight-line segments, interpolating between\n",
    "milestones $q_0=q_s, q_1, \\ldots, q_{k-1}, q_k=q_g$. Any value of\n",
    "$\\theta$ dictates the shape of some path, and any piecewise linear path\n",
    "with $k$ segments corresponds to some value of $\\theta$. To make this\n",
    "dependence clear, we shall refer to the path defined by some value\n",
    "$\\theta$ as $y_\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dimension of C-space is $d$, then $N = d(k-1)$. Hence the\n",
    "trajectory optimization problem can be quite high dimensional (hundreds\n",
    "or thousands of dimensions) even for C-spaces with a moderate number of\n",
    "dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we must encode the objective function and constraints. For\n",
    "minimizing path length, it may be tempting to initially define the\n",
    "following cost function that minimizes path length:\n",
    "$$f(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\| q_i - q_{i-1} \\|.$$ However, this\n",
    "formulation has the drawback that it is not differentiable when two\n",
    "milestones are equal, and also has a null direction when three\n",
    "milestones are on the straight line. It is more numerically convenient\n",
    "to minimize the sum of squared distances\n",
    "$$f(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\| q_i - q_{i-1} \\|^2.$$ which, if a\n",
    "$k$-segment piecewise linear path is indeed optimal, is minimized when\n",
    "the path (nearly) has minimum length and the milestones are evenly\n",
    "spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us proceed to defining constraints, which we assume are in the\n",
    "form $g(q) \\leq 0$. At first glance, one might choose to simply enforce\n",
    "constraints on the milestones:\n",
    "$$h(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix}{g(q_1)} \\\\ {\\vdots} \\\\ {g(q_{k-1})} \\end{bmatrix} \\leq 0.$$\n",
    "However, this runs the risk of having two milestones on either side of\n",
    "an obstacle, with the intermediate segment crossing the obstacle.\n",
    "Instead, we must consider the possibility of constraint violations\n",
    "between milestones. A straightforward way to do so is to use\n",
    "*collocation points*, which are points along the path at which\n",
    "constraints will be enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we can define some number $M$ of collocation points at\n",
    "parameters $s_1,\\ldots,s_M \\in [0,1]$, usually evenly distributed along\n",
    "the parameter space $[0,1]$. The $j$'th collocation point lies on a\n",
    "segment indexed by $i_j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$ and lies a fraction\n",
    "$u_j \\in [0,1]$ along the straight line segment, where these are\n",
    "determined so that the configuration at the collocation point is:\n",
    "$$y_\\theta(s_j) = q_{i_j-1} + u_j (q_{i_j} - q_{i_j-1}).$$ We then\n",

    "$$h(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix}{g(y_\\theta(s_1))} \\\\ {\\vdots} \\\\ {g(y_\\theta(s_M))} \\end{bmatrix} \\leq 0.$$\n",
