    "It might come as a surprise that it is actually tricky to define the\n",
    "word \"robot.\" Contrast the idea of a science fiction android with a\n",
    "remote control flying drone. The android (appears) to think, feel, and\n",
    "move with the intellect of a human, while the drone simply executes the\n",
    "command of its operator. Yet, most people are in agreement that they can\n",

    "There are some *necessary* conditions for something to be a robot. A\n",
    "robot is a machine that:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Moves in the physical world,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Senses its environment and/or itself, and\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Uses computational elements to generate its movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these are not *sufficient* for qualifying a machine as a robot.\n",
    "For example, your washing machine (if built in the last 10 years) will\n",
    "likely have all of these characteristics. A washing machine certainly\n",
    "moves; it senses the settings of its controls, the weight of your\n",
    "laundry, the incoming water temperature, possibly the dirtiness of your\n",
    "laundry, and so on; and will adjust its cycle speeds and duration\n",
    "accordingly using computation circuits. But there seems to be something\n",
    "missing here, since few people would refer to their washing machine as a\n",
    "robot! Similarly, your (relatively modern) car performs fuel injection,\n",
    "anti-lock braking, cruise control, and airbag deployment using several\n",
    "computers and sensors to monitor fuel efficiency, tire pressure,\n",
    "velocity, seat occupancy, etc. Yet, we are not ready to call it a robot\n",

    "-   Exhibit autonomy or automation, and\n",

    "-   Exhibit apparently intelligent behavior?\n",

    "remote-controlled drone mentioned above, or surgical robots under\n",
    "surgeon control, like the Intuitive Surgical Da Vinci robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "An intelligence criterion is also difficult to apply because since it is\n",
    "challenging to define \"intelligence\" without delving into a\n",
    "philosophical minefield! By using the phrase \"apparently intelligent\", we\n",
    "sidestep the issue by assuming a human judge. But what is agreed upon as\n",
    "\"intelligent\" may change from year to year; compared to those devices in\n",
    "the 1950's, our modern washing machines and cars are actually quite\n",
    "smart! Perhaps as the control and artificial intelligence technology\n",

    "non-robot machines will become blurrier and blurrier... until the term\n",
    "\"robot\" has lost its meaning.\n",

    "How to develop a robot\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A roboticist is a thinker, not a tinkerer. Although many students begin\n",
    "tinkering with robots at a relatively young age, this process is not\n",
    "usually the best way to develop a robot that performs a task well.\n",
    "Robotics is a more *deliberate* way of reaching the end goal that is\n",
    "informed through decades of prior research, analysis, and practical\n",
    "experience. One way to define it would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Robotics**: the study of systematic, principled techniques to aid in\n",
    "> the development of robots that perform desired functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although robots are some of the most complex machines in the world,\n",
    "there is a logic to how they should be developed. A good roboticist will\n",
    "follow this logic whilst using any available techniques at his/her\n",
    "disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the recipe for developing an intelligent robot must follow\n",
    "these major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Fabrication**: Design and fabricate a mechanism with sensing, actuation, and\n",
    "    computing capabilities to fulfill the intended task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Measurement**: Develop measurement apparatus(es) and a testing protocol to observe\n",
    "    the function of the mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calibration**: Use measurements to calibrate (or learn) a model of the mechanism's\n",
    "    dynamics, actuation, and sensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Control**: Develop and validate a control sub-system that maintains system\n",
    "    stability and provides medium-level functionality for planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Knowledge representation**: Decide upon a knowledge representation to be shared between planning\n",
    "    and perception sub-systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Perception**: Develop and evaluate a perception sub-system that produces knowledge\n",
    "    relevant to the task (robot state, maps, object identities)\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Planning**: Implement and test a planning sub-system that generates feasible\n",
    "    trajectories to accomplish high-level tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Supervisor**: Develop a high-level supervisor that schedules tasks, provides a\n",
    "    user interface, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Testing and evaluation**: Test the entire system in the field (on the real task in the real\n",
    "    world, and perhaps with human end-users).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these steps are almost never followed\n",
    "linearly, because robot design is a cyclic process of trial and error.\n",
    "Any robotics project will incur many, many *design cycles* over its\n",
    "lifetime. For example, unless the team is limited to an established\n",
    "robot platform, or purchasing off-the-shelf parts, redesigns of the\n",
    "mechanism usually occur after steps 3, 4, and 6. Mechanical redesigns\n",
    "may also occur after planning tests to make task execution more\n",
    "successful. On the software side, new knowledge, perception, and\n",
    "planning requirements are bound to arise as tasks are tested more\n",
    "thoroughly. After testing with end-users, it is not uncommon to go all\n",
    "the way \"back to the drawing board\" to build a new mechanism! A wise\n",
    "roboticist will develop their later components to rapidly accommodate\n",
    "minor mechanical changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying an established robot platform can greatly speed up development\n",
    "time by shortcutting steps 1-4, but many vendors sell fairly raw\n",
    "hardware (requiring a rehash of steps 2-4). Also, there may be\n",
    "locked-in decisions that prevent certain functionality to be implemented\n",
    "later. To use a robot as a haptic device, make sure its motor\n",
    "controllers provide high-rate feedback and a force control mode! To have\n",
    "your robot navigate outdoors, make sure that it has a laser sensor or\n",
    "stereo vision rather than a structured light sensor! This makes it very\n",
    "important to examine the technical specs of a robot &mdash; even the most\n",
    "mundane details &mdash; with a fine-toothed comb before making a purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory, mathematics, and algorithms that are discussed in this book\n",
    "are designed to facilitate the development of functional robots. For\n",
    "example, it is unnecessary to go to \"square one\" for every component of\n",
    "a robot, as long as that component is deeply understood. A good\n",
    "roboticist will understand which off-the-shelf techniques apply, and\n",
    "where. However, there is no substitute for real-world testing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is one of the most painful parts of robotics, but ultimately one\n",
    "of its most satisfying. Although a given technique might be\n",
    "theoretically beautiful, it will have been largely tested in the lab,\n",
    "making certain idealizations of the real world, or for a slightly\n",
    "different use case. The bulk of time spent doing robotics work is\n",
    "usually tweaking, tuning, and testing these tried-and-true techniques\n",
    "until they fit for the problem at hand. But once the technique is\n",
    "validated by thorough field testing, its merits are unimpeachable!\n",

    "\n",
    "-   \"Minds the gaps:\" understands how their sub-system works with other\n",

    "## Abstractions\n",
    "\n",
    "> **System** (n). A thing of such complexity that a human can only begin to comprehend it using cartoons.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement, although tongue-in-cheek, is actually fairly\n",
    "accurate.  A system is composed of many interacting parts, each of which is individually complex,\n",
    "and it would take ages to understand deeply how everything works and interacts. \n",
    "The \"cartoons\" referred to above are known (especially in the computing world)\n",
    "as **abstractions**.  An abstraction is a \"black box\" with inputs and outputs\n",
    "that performs some understandable function, which lets you ignore, to some\n",
    "extent, what goes on \"under the hood\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to a first approximation, the basic function of a car is to\n",
    "turn on when a key is turned in the ignition, steer when the steering wheel is turned,\n",
    "accelerate when the accelerator is pressed, and decelerate when the brake is pressed.\n",
    "This is the implied *contract* that the abstraction of a car makes with to a user; \n",
    "it makes little difference what type of material the tires are made of, the amount of wear\n",
    "on the brake pads, the function of the differential, whether the engine's fuel air mixture\n",
    "is controlled by computer or carburetor, whether the car's chassis was welded by robot or by human, or even whether the motor is an electric or combustion engine.  It can generally be assumed that driving the car will take you from point A to point B, assuming that A and B are connected by roads and that we know how to operate a car.  But a car is an incredibly complex machine, comprised of tens of thousands of mechanical parts, and modern cars have millions of lines of computer code.  We don't have to understand each of these little components; the car just works as a transportation device.  This is the cartoon we tell ourselves, and most of the time the car operates just as the cartoon tells us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, you say, but what if the car is out of gas, or a tire is flat, or a family of bears has broken into your car and set up a den in the back seat?  Well, these areas in which the cartoon \"breaks down\".  This is also known as a *leaky abstraction*, because some factors that were unspecified in our abstract, assumed contract have \"leaked\" into the black box to cause unexpected or undesirable behavior.  A famous software engineering principle states that [\"all abstractions are, to some extent, leaky\"](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/).  This certainly holds true for robotics as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The development of a robot will certainly generate many interacting components, each of which performs a complex mechanical or software function.  Due to this complexity, multiple engineers will work on multiple components, and the only way to tractably comprehend the entire system is through abstraction.  A good engineer will properly *label* their component and *summarize* its function in an easy to understand manner.  E.g., the perception module gives the identity and location of all of the interesting things in view of the robot's cameras; the planning module waits for an instruction from a user and then plans a motion to act as requested; the controller module executes a current motion, and updates the motion whenever the planner requests it; the UI module shows the user the state of the robot, performs speech recognition, and translates words into recognized commands.  Moreover, she will *document* the components' specifications in a way that other engineers can use it in a predictable manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important function of abstractions is that they let us swap **implementations** of what goes on \"under the hood\".  We will describe several IK solvers, motion planners, trajectory optimizers, state estimators, and object recognizers.  All of them, although they may perform the same intended function, will differ in terms of performance characteristics (e.g., for algorithms, computational complexity, failure rates, network usage; for hardware, speed, strength, noise, and power consumption).  Different versions of an algorithm's code will also be swappable, and may have vastly different performance characteristics.  For example, 3D mapping on a GPU is orders of magnitude faster than doing it on a CPU.  It is a general rule that there will be many potential implementations of a given robot component, and more will be developed every year. A good architect of a robotic system will need to research and understand the state-of-the-art and plan how the system is developed to optimize the trade-offs between performance, resource usage, and implementation difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major goal of this book is to aid in the process of systems engineering by:\n",
    "1. Defining standard abstractions used in robotics\n",
    "2. Describing where these abstractions leak, why they leak, and what can be done to plug the leaks to the extent possible\n",
    "3. Presenting multiple implementations, and explain their performance characteristics\n",
