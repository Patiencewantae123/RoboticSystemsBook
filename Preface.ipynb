    "## Purpose and scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Robotics is a field in adolescence. From its beginnings in the 1960s with industrial robots, robots have been a fixture in factories. Since then, robotics has been a topic of active research in academic and\n",
    "industry labs, but economic breakthroughs came in fits and starts.\n",
    "Developments in the 1990's led to the success of mobile service robots,\n",
    "like the iRobot Roomba, that perform specific tasks in the home. The\n",
    "2000's saw developments in medical robotics, with radiosurgical and\n",
    "laparoscopic surgical robots being widely adopted in hospitals. In the\n",
    "2010's, advances in inexpensive sensors and actuators, and open-source\n",
    "software have now made it possible to build affordable robots that exhibit\n",
    "complex behaviors in human environments. Moreover, emerging applications\n",
    "like autonomous vehicles, drones, and warehouse robots have attracted\n",
    "billions of dollars of investment with no sign of slowing. However, the\n",
    "field and discipline of robotics is ever-changing. Techniques that were\n",
    "once only evaluated in labs are becoming field-tested in the real world,\n",
    "and new problems are emerging as society poses novel applications for robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this book is to help launch a student's career toward\n",
    "developing the next generation of intelligent robots. These\n",
    "robots will be integrated into humans' daily lives, will understand and\n",
    "react to the world around them, and will perform tasks reliably.\n",
    "Robotics is however a complex and interdisciplinary field that spans\n",
    "mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer programming,\n",
    "and machine learning. At times, it also touches on mathematics,\n",
    "biomechanics, psychology, and neuroscience. This book does not try to\n",
    "teach skills from these fields (e.g., programming or computer-aided\n",
    "design) that are better learned elsewhere. Instead, the philosophy of\n",
    "the book is that *robotics is the engineering and science of systems*.\n",
    "What this means is that the job of a roboticist is to understand how a\n",
    "complex assembly of parts will work as a whole. This requires\n",
    "understanding *both* the functionality of the parts — e.g., sensing\n",
    "the world, understanding the world, making decisions, and taking action\n",
    "— and the connections between them. Building systems is also fun and\n",
    "rewarding. The act of building a robot, toiling for weeks (\\... or\n",
    "months \\...) of effort, and watching it *finally* work (!!!) brings\n",
    "immense excitement and joy to its creators.\n",
    "\n",
    "I argue for taking a systems approach to teaching robotics because it is\n",
    "the most practical way of moving robotics out of the lab and into the\n",
    "real world. I strongly believe that *the future of progress in robotics\n",
    "is in interdisciplinary teams*, and that students taught robotics from a\n",
    "systems perspective will be better prepared to avoid the dysfunctions\n",
    "and pitfalls that tend to emerge from these teams. Perhaps popular media\n",
    "has done a disservice to the field by perpetuating the archetype of a\n",
    "\"lone genius\" developing a fantastical robot (as seen in movies like\n",
    "Iron Man, Big Hero 6, and Ex Machina). It is hard to develop intelligent\n",
    "robots because a huge range of technical expertise is needed\\...\n",
    "Mechanical design! Computer vision! Motion planning! Usability testing!\n",
    "This is more than any one person can do alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when a team of specialists are brought together, each of whom\n",
    "is taught to speak in his/her own technical languages, have his/her own\n",
    "technical concerns, and tend to work in certain \"comfort zones,\" this\n",
    "causes isolation between parts of the project, gaps in understanding,\n",
    "and mistaken assumptions. I have personally seen several projects\n",
    "delayed and/or failed due to specialists' lack of understanding of each\n",
    "others' work, or a failure to understand the workings of a system as a whole. We certainly need specialists,\n",
    "no doubt, but we also need common ground in which to understand the\n",
    "importance of each other's needs, strengths, and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also my opinion that robotics should not be learned by focusing on\n",
    "a particular platform or application, but rather on broadly applicable\n",
    "techniques and skills. Because the field changes so rapidly, the student\n",
    "who learns a single platform runs the risk of sparse opportunities in\n",
    "that area when finishing their studies. Being stuck on a stale\n",
    "application will hamper one's ability to spark insights with\n",
    "colleagues, seeking a job, or starting a company. As a result, the\n",
    "topics in this book are curated to generalize across platforms, like\n",
    "mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, industrial manipulators, humanoid\n",
    "robots, medical robots, and more. To illustrate this philosophy, the\n",
    "vast range of tasks demanded of robot engineers can be thought of as a\n",
    "matrix, with applications in rows and technical areas in columns:\n",

    "technical areas and application areas. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "****************\n",
    "\n",
    "For each entry of this matrix, developing a successful component requires an engineer to blend\n",
    "technical know-how about the subject (column) with the special demands\n",
    "of the application (row).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main sections of the book are arranged *vertically*, covering six\n",
    "technical areas: Mathematical Models, Motion Planning, Dynamics and\n",
    "Control, Perception, Learning and Calibration, and Systems Engineering.\n",
    "(Columns and book sections are not in one-to-one correspondence; the\n",
    "modeling column is split between several sections.) The material covered\n",
    "by the book attempts to survey a mixture of classical, \"tried and true\"\n",
    "topics as well as modern topics that verge on the state-of-the-art. To\n",
    "bookend the technical material with a broader context, the Introduction to\n",
    "Robots section discusses robotics history, and the Application Areas\n",
    "section discusses some of the domain knowledge employed in common\n",

    "-   Intelligent robotics: intro, motion planning, perception, learning\n",
