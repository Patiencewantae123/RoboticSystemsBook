    "One primitive operation that will be used over and over in motion\n",
    "planning is known as *graph search*. In this context, the vertices of\n",
    "the graph are usually points in C-space and edges indicate some notion\n",
    "of local connectivity between points (such as \"a straight line exists\n",
    "from point A to point B\"). In other contexts, the vertices denote a\n",
    "region of C-space, and edges indicate connectivity between regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that a graph only encodes a set of alternatives (edges) at each\n",
    "vertex, but does not contain any information about which edge to take.\n",
    "The purpose of graph search is to determine, exactly and efficiently,\n",
    "the path --- a sequence of edges --- in the graph that connects a start\n",
    "vertex to a goal vertex. Search is a process of *systematically*\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout this book we use *Big-O notation* to describe the performance\n",
    "of various quantities, including the size of data structures and running\n",
    "times of calculations. This notation allows us to specify the most\n",
    "dominant factors affecting performance while ignoring constant terms.\n",
    "Specifically, the statement: $$g(n) \\text{ is } O(f(n))$$ means that\n",
    "above a certain value of $n$, $g(n)$ will be less than some constant\n",
    "times $f(n)$. More specifically, it is defined as the following\n",
    "statement: there exists a value $N$ and a constant $c$ such that for all\n",
    "$n > N$, $g(n) < c f(n)$. In other words, $g$ is asymptotically bounded\n",
    "by $f$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if $g(n)$ is a complex expression, it is possible to determine a\n",
    "simple expression for $f(n)$. For example, if\n",
    "$g(n) = 30 n^4 - 12 n^2  + 1000 n$, the dominant term as $n$ grows is\n",
    "the $n^4$ term, and we can say $g(n)$ is $O(n^4)$. We will seek the\n",
    "simplest expression for $f$ that fulfills the big-O requirement while\n",
    "also remaining a tight bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common Big-O expressions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $O(1)$: constant.\n",
    "- $O(n)$: upper bounded by a linear function.\n",
    "- $O(n^2)$: upper bounded by a quadratic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O notation also generalizes to functions of multiple variables. For\n",
    "example, the statement \"$4 mn - 30 m^{1.5} + 200n$ is $O(mn + m^{1.5})$\"\n",
    "holds because for any fixed value of $m > 1$, the big-O expression holds\n",
    "for $n$, and likewise for any fixed $n > 1$ the expression holds for\n",
    "$m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph search\n",
    "\n",
    "Given start and goal vertices, respectively $s,g \\in V$, the goal of\n",
    "graph search is to find a sequence of vertices:\n",
    "$$v_0 = s, v_1, \\ldots, v_k = g \\text{ such that }(v_{i-1},v_{i}) \\in E\\text{ for all }i=1,...k.$$\n",
    "The number of steps $k$ in the path is not fixed. If there does not\n",
    "exist a path (that is, $s$ and $g$ are disconnected), then search should\n",
    "return \"no path.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also ascribe a notion of cost $c(u,v) > 0$ to each edge, in which\n",
    "case our goal is to find the *optimal path*, that is, the sequence of\n",
    "vertices such that the total path cost $$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} c(v_{i-1},v_i)$$\n",
    "is minimized among all paths connecting the start and goal. If no cost\n",
    "is given, then all edges are assumed to have uniform cost and we wish to\n",
    "optimize the total number of edges in a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dijkstra's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous graph search method is *Dijkstra's algorithm*. It\n",
    "calculates an optimal path when one exists, and works in\n",
    "$O(|E| + |V| \\log |V|$) time and $O(|V|$) space, when implemented with\n",
    "an appropriate priority queue data structure. The general idea is to\n",
    "iterate through all unexplored vertices, ordered in increasing cost from\n",
    "the start (cost-to-come) $d[v]$ . All vertices have estimated\n",
    "cost-to-come set to $d[v] = \\infty$ at the beginning, except for the\n",
