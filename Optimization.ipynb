    "Unconstrained optimization\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the optimal (minimum or maximum) value of a real-valued function\n",
    "is a ubiquitous operation in mathematics, engineering, physics, and\n",
    "computer science. This section will discuss mathematical criteria for\n",
    "defining the existence of optima and some numerical approaches for\n",
    "finding them. Minimization is also closely connected to problem of\n",
    "root-finding, which is an important problem in its own right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider the problem of finding the minimum value that a\n",
    "real-valued function $f :\\mathbb{R}^n \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ takes on over\n",
    "the reals. (The problem of maximizing $f$ can be solved by finding the\n",
    "minimum of $-f$, so we will typically only concern ourselves with\n",
    "minimization.) This is known as *unconstrained optimization*. The\n",
    "problem where the domain is limited to a closed set, such as an interval\n",
    "$[a,b]$, is known as *constrained optimization*, and will be covered in\n",
    "the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical notation and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it may be possible to examine the function by hand and\n",
    "use mathematical tools to find a closed-form expression of the minimum.\n",
    "When this is possible, such a solution can be very valuable because it\n",
    "can be evaluated quickly on a computer or can be used in further\n",
    "mathematical transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Existence and necessary conditions of a minimum\n",
    "The minimum of $f$ over a domain $S$ is a value $m$ such that $m=f(c)$\n",
    "for some value $c \\in S$ and that $m \\leq f(x)$. If such a value exists,\n",
    "we write: $$m = \\min_{x \\in S} f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Argument of the minimum\n",
    "We may also be interested in obtaining the x-values $c$ that attains\n",
    "this minimum. This is known as an *argument of the minimum* (or arg min)\n",
    "$$c = \\arg\\min_{x \\in S} f(x).$$ Since a function may attain its minimum\n",
    "at multiple points, the $\\arg\\min$ is technically a set of points. It\n",
    "may also be an empty set if the minimum is not defined, e.g.\n",
    "$\\arg \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local minima and critical points\n",
    "A value $x$ for which $f$ obtains its maximum over some open interval\n",
    "containing $x$ is known as a *local minimum* (or maximum) of $f$. If $f$\n",
    "is differentiable, then one condition for local optimality is that the\n",
    "derivative of $f$ vanishes at $x$ (Figure 1). In other words, if $f$\n",
    "attains a minimum (or maximum) at $x$ over the interval $(a,b)$, then\n",
    "$f^\\prime(x) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this fact, we will prove the contrapositive: if $x \\in (a,b)$\n",
    "is a point where $f^\\prime(x) = L \\neq 0$, then $x$ is not a local\n",
    "minimum. Using the definition of a limit,\n",
    "$$L = f^\\prime(x)  = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} (f(x+h)-f(x))/h.$$ This means\n",
    "that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can pick a $\\delta$ such that\n",
    "$|(f(x+h)-f(x))/h-L| < \\epsilon$ as long as $|h|\\leq \\delta$. Since\n",
    "$(a,b)$ is an open set, we can choose $\\delta$ small enough so that\n",
    "$(x-\\delta,x+\\delta) \\subseteq (a,b)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $L$ is positive, pick $h=\\delta$. Then we have\n",
    "$$(f(x+\\delta)-f(x))/\\delta-L < \\epsilon$$ Which can be rearranged to\n",
    "obtain $$f(x+\\delta) < f(x)+(L+\\epsilon)\\delta.$$ Hence, $f(x+\\delta)$\n",
    "is lower than $f(x)$, and hence $f(x)$ is not a minimizer of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if $L$ is negative, pick $h=-\\delta$. Then we have\n",
    "$$-\\epsilon < -(f(x-\\delta)-f(x))/\\delta-L$$ Which can be rearranged to\n",
    "obtain $$f(x-\\delta)  < f(x)-\\delta(L-\\epsilon).$$ Since $L-\\epsilon$ is\n",
    "negative, this shows that $f(x-\\delta)$ is lower than $f(x)$, and hence\n",
    "$f(x)$ is not a minimizer either. QED\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is often useful to find all points where $f^\\prime(x) = 0$.\n",
    "These are known as *critical points*. All local minima and maxima are\n",
    "critical points. However, not all critical points are local minima and\n",
    "maxima, as the example $f(x) = x^3$ shows. The derivative vanishes at\n",
    "$x=0$, but the function does not obtain a local extremum. Critical\n",
    "points that are not local extrema are known as *inflection points*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second derivative test\n",
    "If $f$ is twice differentiable at $x$, then a *sufficient condition* for\n",
    "a critical point $x$ to be a local minimum is that the second derivative\n",
    "is positive. In other words, $f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) > 0$. To show this,\n",
    "consider the definition of the second derivative:\n",
    "$$f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}(f^\\prime(x+h)-f^\\prime(x))/h$$\n",
    "Since $x$ is a critical point, $f^\\prime(x)=0$, so\n",
    "$$f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}f^\\prime(x+h)/h$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) > 0$, then we can find a $\\delta$ small enough\n",
    "such that for all $|h|\\leq \\delta$, $f^\\prime(x+h)/h > 0$. Hence, if\n",
    "$h > 0$, then $f^\\prime(x+h) > 0$, which means that $f^\\prime$ is\n",
    "positive to the right of $x$. If $h < 0$, then $f^\\prime(x+h) < 0$,\n",
    "which means that $f^\\prime$ is negative to the left of $x$. This means\n",
    "that on the range $(x,x+\\delta)$, $f$ is monotonically increasing, and\n",
    "$(x-\\delta,x)$, $f$ is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, on the range\n",
    "$(x-\\delta,x+\\delta)$, $x$ minimizes $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, however, $f$ can be very complex, so it may be difficult\n",
    "or impossible to find a closed form expression. Or, $f$ may be given as\n",
    "a black-box computer subroutine, and so a mathematical expression may\n",
    "not be available. In these cases we must resort to numerical (iterative)\n",
    "techniques in order to find a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first multivariate optimization technique we will examine is one of\n",
    "the simplest: gradient descent (also known as steepest descent).\n",
    "Gradient descent is an iterative method that is given an initial point,\n",
    "and follows the negative of the gradient in order to move the point\n",
    "toward a critical point, which is hopefully the desired local minimum.\n",
    "Again we are concerned with only local optimization, because global\n",
    "optimization is computationally challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is popular for very large-scale optimization problems\n",
    "because it is easy to implement, can handle \"black box\" functions, and\n",
    "each iteration is cheap. Its major disadvantage is that it can take a\n",
    "long time to converge. We will also describe a discrete descent method\n",
    "often used to solve large combinatorial problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a differentiable scalar field $f(\\textbf{x})$ and an initial guess\n",
    "$\\textbf{x}_1$, gradient descent iteratively moves the guess toward lower\n",
    "values of $f$ by taking steps in the direction of the negative gradient\n",
    "$-\\nabla f(\\textbf{x})$. Locally, the negated gradient is the steepest\n",
    "descent direction, i.e., the direction that $\\textbf{x}$ would need to move\n",
    "in order to decrease $f$ the fastest. The algorithm typically converges\n",
    "to a local minimum, but may rarely reach a saddle point, or not move at\n",
    "all if $\\textbf{x}_{1}$ lies at a local maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The gradient is the steepest descent direction\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order Taylor approximation of $f(\\textbf{x})$ about $f(\\textbf{x}_{1})$ is\n",
    "$$f(\\textbf{x}) = f(\\textbf{x}_{1}) + \\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{1}) \\cdot (\\textbf{x}-\\textbf{x}_{1}) + O(||\\textbf{x}-\\textbf{x}_{1}||^2).$$\n",
    "Consider moving from $\\textbf{x}_{1}$ a small amount $h$ in a unit direction\n",
    "$\\textbf{u}$. We want to find the $\\textbf{u}$ that minimizes\n",
    "$f(\\textbf{x}_{1} + h\\textbf{u})$. Using the Taylor expansion, we see that\n",
    "$$f(\\textbf{x}_{1} + h\\textbf{u}) - f(\\textbf{x}_{1}) =  h \\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{1}) \\cdot \\textbf{u} +  h^2 O(1).$$\n",
    "If we make the $h^2$ term insignificant by shrinking $h$, we see that in\n",
    "order to decrease $f(\\textbf{x}_{1} + h\\textbf{u}) - f(\\textbf{x}_{1})$ the fastest we must\n",
    "minimize $\\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{1}) \\cdot \\textbf{u}$. The unit vector that minimizes\n",
    "$\\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{1}) \\cdot \\textbf{u}$ is\n",
    "$\\textbf{u} = -\\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{1}) / || \\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{1}) ||$ as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is initialized with a guess $\\textbf{x}_{1}$, a maximum iteration\n",
    "count $N_{max}$, a gradient norm tolerance $\\epsilon_g$ that is used to\n",
    "determine whether the algorithm has arrived at a critical point, and a\n",
    "step tolerance $\\epsilon_x$ to determine whether significant progress is\n",
    "being made. It proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*****************\n",
    "<a name=\"alg:GradientDescent\">Algorithm</a> Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **for** {$t=1,2,\\ldots,N_{max}$}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\\textbf{x}_{t+1} \\gets \\textbf{x}_{t} - \\alpha_t \\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{t})$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **if** $\\|\\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{t})\\| < \\epsilon_g$ **return** \"Converged\n",

    "\n",
    "6. **return** \"Maximum number of iterations reached\"\n",
    "*****************\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable $\\alpha_t$ is known as the *step size*, and should be\n",
    "chosen to maintain a balance between convergence speed and avoiding\n",
    "divergence. Note that $\\alpha_t$ may depend on the step $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing a step size using line search\n",
    "\n",
    "To a first-order approximation, each step decreases the value of $f$ by\n",
    "approximately $\\alpha_t ||\\nabla f(\\textbf{x}_{0})||^2$. If $\\alpha_t$ is too\n",
    "small, then the algorithm will converge very slowly. On the other hand,\n",
    "if the step size $\\alpha_t$ is not chosen small enough, then the\n",
    "algorithm may fail to reduce the value of $f$. (Because the first order\n",
    "approximation is valid only locally.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to *adapt* the step size $\\alpha_t$ in order to achieve\n",
    "a reduction in $f$ while still making sufficiently fast progress. This\n",
    "procedure is known as a *line search* and is employed in many\n",
    "multivariate optimization algorithms. The input to a line search is a\n",
    "function $f$, an initial point $\\textbf{x}$ and direction $\\textbf{d}$, initial\n",
    "candidate step size $\\gamma_1$. The output is a step size $\\gamma > 0$\n",
    "such that $f(\\textbf{x}+\\gamma \\textbf{d}) < f(\\textbf{x})$, or failure if the step\n",
    "size falls below some threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to check whether $\\textbf{x} + \\gamma_1 \\textbf{d}$ decreases\n",
    "the value of $f$. If so, then we can either terminate the line search,\n",
    "or search for a larger valid $\\gamma$ by repeated doubling:\n",
    "$\\gamma_n = \\gamma_1 2^n$. If a step of size $\\gamma_1$ increases $f$,\n",
    "then we search through repeated halving:\n",
    "$\\gamma_n = \\frac{\\gamma_1}{2^n}$. This continues until a reduction in\n",
    "$f$ is found, or minimum step size tolerance is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking, \"wouldn't it make sense for line search to find\n",
    "the *optimal* step size rather than any one that reduces the function\n",
    "value?\" It turns out that in practice it is usually not worthwhile to do\n",
    "extra work to obtain an optimal line search because moving along the\n",
    "current line typically doesn't get you much closer to the local minimum.\n",
    "More often it is a better use of time to take a step and get a new\n",
    "gradient direction at the next point. Nevertheless it is sometimes\n",
    "useful during analysis to assume that optimal line searches are being\n",
    "performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pathological cases\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be proven, through a relatively technical proof, that gradient\n",
    "descent with an optimal line search obtains a linear convergence.\n",
    "However, there are cases in which the convergence constant is very bad,\n",
    "that is, the error ratio $E_{t+1} / E_{t}$ is close to 1. This occurs\n",
    "when the eigenvalues of $f$'s second derivative matrix, known as the\n",
    "Hessian matrix, is poorly \"scaled\" at the minimum. Here we will provide\n",
    "some intuition for the causes of slow convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a very simple quadratic function in a two dimensional Euclidean\n",
    "space: $f(x_1,x_2) = a x_1^2 + b x_2^2$, with positive constants $a$ and\n",
    "$b$. The gradient of $f$ is $(2 a x_1, 2 b x_2)$, and of course the\n",
    "minimum of $f$ is at the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $a=b$, then $f$ increases isotropically from the origin in every\n",
    "direction (Figure 1). Another way to think of this is that the level\n",
    "sets of $f$ are circles. At a point $(x_1,x_2)$, observe that\n",
    "$-\\nabla f(x_1,x_2)$ points directly toward the origin. Hence, gradient\n",
    "descent moves any initial point directly toward the origin, and it will\n",
    "perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the case where $b >> a$, say $b=100a$. Now the level sets\n",
    "of $f$ are ellipses that are thinner in the $x_1$ direction (Figure 2).\n",
    "At a point $(x_1,x_2)$, the descent direction\n",
    "$-\\nabla f(x_1,x_2) = (-2 a x_1, -2 b x_2)$ is steeper along the $x_2$\n",
    "axis than the $x_1$ axis. So, the line search will not be directed\n",
    "toward the origin. This gives gradient descent a characteristic\n",
    "zig-zagging trajectory that takes longer to converge to the minimum. In\n",
    "general, slow convergence holds when the \"bowl\" around the local minimum\n",
    "is much thinner in one direction than another. Problems like this are\n",
    "said to have an *ill-conditioned* Hessian matrix. We will make this more\n",
    "precise in future lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent can be generalized to spaces that involve a discrete\n",
    "component. The method of *steepest descent* is the discrete analogue of\n",
    "gradient descent, but the best move is computed using a local\n",
    "minimization rather rather than computing a gradient. It is typically\n",
    "able to converge in few steps but it is unable to escape local minima or\n",
    "plateaus in the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete search problem is defined by a discrete state space $S$ and a\n",
    "set of edges $E \\subseteq S \\times S$. This induces a graph $G=(S,E)$\n",
    "that must be searched in order to find a state that minimizes a given\n",
    "function $f(s)$. A steepest descent search begins at a state $s_0$ and\n",
    "takes steps on $G$ that descend $f(s)$ with the maximum rate of descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm repeatedly computes each transition\n",
    "$s\\rightarrow s^\\prime$ by performing the local minimization\n",
    "$\\arg \\min_{s\\rightarrow s^\\prime \\in E} f(s^\\prime)$, and terminates\n",
    "when $f(s^\\prime) \\geq f(s)$. This approach is typically much faster\n",
    "than an exhaustive search if $S$ is large or possibly infinite but the\n",
    "degree of $G$ is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hill climbing* is a similar approach to steepest descent that is used\n",
    "for large discrete problems in which the state space is combinatorial.\n",
    "(Although the name is hill *climbing* the approach can be applied to\n",
    "either minimization or maximization.) If the state is composed of\n",
    "several attributes $s=(s_1,\\ldots,s_n)$, an optimization can be\n",
    "formulated over the composite state space\n",
    "$S = S_1 \\times \\cdots \\times S_n$. In each iteration, each of the\n",
    "attributes $s_i$ is locally optimized in $S_i$ using a single step of\n",
    "steepest descent. These sweeps continue until convergence or a\n",
    "termination condition is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random restarts\n",
    "\n",
    "Local optimization techniques are not guaranteed to find the global\n",
    "minimum unless it can be proven that the function under question has\n",
    "only a single minimum or that the initial guess is within the *basin of\n",
    "attraction* of the global minimum. Moreover, hard optimization problems\n",
    "are often riddled with local minima. Nevertheless it is possible to\n",
    "improve the chance of finding a global minimum by performing many local\n",
    "optimizations with randomly chosen initial points, and picking the\n",
    "locally optimized point with the lowest $f$ value. This strategy is\n",
    "known as steepest descent with random restarts. Quantifying the\n",
    "probability that random restarts find a global minimum is left as an\n",

    "Analysis and methods for solving these types of problems are considerably more complex than unconstrained optimization techniques.  So, it is very convenient to use software toolboxes that allow constrained problems to be solved as a \"black box\", where the user needs only a minimum of understanding of the underlying methods in order to obtain satisfactory results.  That said, algorithmic breakthroughs are often made by understanding constrained optimization more deeply (e.g., support vector machines in machine learning, time scaling methods in robot trajectory optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimization on an interval\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Extreme Value Theorem**. The Extreme Value Theorem states that a continuous function $f$ does\n",
    "> indeed attain a minimum and maximum over a closed interval $[a,b]$ at\n",
    "> some points $c$ and $d$ in $[a,b]$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it may seem\n",
    "like a trivial statement, it is possible to construct examples where the\n",
    "minimum and maximum cannot be attained over an interval that is not\n",
    "closed, or not bounded, or when the function is discontinuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where the minimum $c$ is in the interior of the interval $(a,b)$, and the derivative of $f$ exists, then $c$ is a critical point, i.e., $f^\\prime(c)=0$. If it is not in the interior, then either $c=a$ or $c=b$.  This gives rise to an \"algorithm\" for finding the minimum on an interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine all critical points of $f$ in the open interval $(a,b)$.  Let these be called $x_1,\\ldots,x_k$.\n",
    "2. Return $min f(a), f(b), f(x_1), \\ldots, f(x_k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lagrange multipliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now consider the multi-dimensional constrained optimization case with only equality constraints, i.e., $min_x f(x)$ such that $h(x)=0$.  The minimum may not be a critical point of $f$, because most critical points are very unlikely to satisfy $h(x)=0$.  If we are to consider the set of points (a manifold) that satisfies $h(x)=0$, the conditions for optimality state that we cannot move *along this manifold* without reducing the value of $f(x)$.  This is made more precisely with the condition of *Lagrange multipliers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the Lagrange multipliers give us a way to define a critical point in an equality-constrained setting, which is a necessary condition for a point to be optimal. Specifically, we define a vector of Lagrange multipliers $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$.  The condition states if $x^\\star$ is a minimizer of the equality-constrained optimization, then there exists some $\\lambda^\\star$ satisfying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla f(x^\\star) + \\lambda^{\\star T} \\nabla h(x^\\star) = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This, along with the condition $h(x^\\star) == 0$, gives a way to characterize all critical points on the manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clearer to understand what this means in the case of a single constraint $p=1$.  Then $\\lambda$ is a scalar, and $\\nabla h(x^\\star)$ is a gradient vector perpendicular to the surface $h(x)=0$ at $x^\\star$.  The Lagrange condition becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla f(x^\\star) + \\lambda^\\star \\nabla h(x^\\star) = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\lambda^\\star$ can be arbitrary, this means that at $x^\\star$, $\\nabla f$ and $\\nabla h$ are $\\textit{aligned}$,  Moreover, $\\nabla f \\neq 0$.  It does not matter how the gradients are scaled with respect to one another, since $\\lambda^\\star$ can vary freely.  In other words, the direction in which $x$ is \"pulled\" by the gradient of $f$ is canceled out because it cannot move along the surface $h(x)=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple-constraint case is simply an analogue of this, to account for the multiple constraint gradient directions being able to combine, in arbitrary linear combinations, to cancel out the \"pull\" of $\\nabla f$.\n",

    "For problems with both inequality and equality constraints, the Lagrange multiplier conditions can be extended to form the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.  Let us first consider the case where only inequality constraints are present.  The set of $x$ satisfying $g(x) \\leq 0$ is called the *feasible* set, and we wish to characterize the minimum of $f$ and the minimizing point $x^\\star$ over this set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The KKT conditions are in some sense an analogue of the Extreme Value Theorem, and state that an optimum must be either a critical point in the interior of the feasible set, or it must be on the boundary of the feasible region.  Now, if we knew on which boundary of the feasible region it lies, then the Lagrange multiplier conditions become \"active\" along that boundary and determine the set of critical points. \n",

If we want the point to be a minimizer, we also include a minus sign in the Langrangian derivative, and require that $\\mu > 0$ needs to hold.  Otherwise, $f$ can be reduced by moving toward the interior of the feasible set.\n",

    "This set of options could be analyzed one-by-one to characterize all critical points.  But as we add more dimensions to $g$, the options become unwieldy. Consider the $m=2$ case, $g(x) = [g_1(x),g_2(x)]$.  Either\n",

    "In both cases, the two classes of techniques that are most often used are active-set methods and interior-point methods.  Briefly speaking, active set methods iterate on a subset of inequality constraints that may be solved to equality.  With only equality constraints active, the minimizing direction of a LP or QP can be computed efficiently.  Interior point methods convert the inequality and equality constraints into *barrier functions* that penalize violation of constraints.  These penalties are incorporated into the objective function, which is then addressed using unconstrained optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "For QPs solvers to converge to a unique minimum, $P$ must either be [positive semi-definite](LinearAlgebra.ipynb#Positive-definiteness) or, for some solvers, strictly positive definite.  This is because for non-positive-definite matrices, the objective function is not convex, and there exist suboptimal local optima on the feasible set boundary.\n",

    "Professional-grade LP and QP software is widely available, highly reliable, and scales to thousands and even millions of variables and constraints. Example software packages include GLPK, Gurobi, and CVXOPT.  In order to get optimal scalability to large problems, the A, C, and P matrices ought to be representable using _sparse matrices_ (that is, $m\\times n$ matrices in which the number of nonzero entries is $O(m+n)$ rather than $O(mn)$), and a package that can exploit sparsity should be employed.\n",
