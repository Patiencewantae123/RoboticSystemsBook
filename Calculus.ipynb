    "We would like to extend concepts that are familiar to us from working\n",
    "with real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ to other spaces of interest. For example,\n",
    "through much of this class we will operate in $n$-dimensional Euclidean\n",
    "spaces $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Elements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (points) are simply\n",
    "tuples of $n$ real numbers. In this section we extend our understanding\n",
    "the notions of sequences, limits, derivatives, and closed and open\n",

    "## Metric spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A metric space $S$ is an arbitrary abstract set equipped with a *metric*\n",
    "$d(x,y)$ that measures a sense of distance between points. The metric is\n",
    "required to be 1) nonnegative ($d(x,y) \\geq 0$), 2) reflexive\n",
    "($d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x=y$) and 3) symmetric ($d(x,y) = d(y,x)$). It is\n",
    "also required to satisfy the triangle inequality:\n",
    "$d(x,y) \\leq d(x,z)+d(z,y)$ for all $x,y,z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $\\mathbb{R}$ is a metric space under the absolute distance metric\n",
    "    $d(x,y)=|x-y|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Any Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a metric space under the\n",
    "    Euclidean distance metric (and indeed, many other metrics).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Any set is a metric space under the discrete metric: $d(x,y) = 0$ if\n",
    "    $x=y$, and $d(x,y) = 1$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily generalize the notions of convergence and limits of\n",
    "sequences into the metric space setting. This is done simply by\n",
    "replacing the absolute distances $|x-y|$ with the metric $d(x,y)$.\n",
    "Limits of a function also generalize, but only in the standard case\n",
    "(taken relative to some point $c$). The one-sided and asymptotic limits\n",
    "do not generalize in the same way, nor do the notions of\n",

    "> **Neighborhood**. For a metric space $(S,d)$, the $r$-neighborhood of a point $x\\in S$ is\n",
    "> the set $N_r(x) = { y\\in S | d(x,y) < r }$. For a Euclidean space\n",
    "> $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and the Euclidean metric, this is a ball of dimension $n$\n",
    "> and radius $r$ centered on $x$, not including its surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Open set**. An *open set* $A$ is a subset of a metric space $(S,d)$ such that every\n",
    "> point $x \\in A$ has an $r$-neighborhood completely contained within $A$\n",
    "> with some $r > 0$. More precisely, for all $x$, there exists an $r > 0$\n",
    "> such that $N_r(x) \\subseteq A$. (Note that $r$ is allowed to depend on\n",
    "> $x$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Closed set**. A *closed set* $A$ is a subset of a metric space $(S,d)$ such that its\n",
    "> complement $S \\setminus A$ is an open set. (Note: typically the\n",
    "> \"universe\" of possible elements $S$ is known and is therefore left\n",
    "> implicit.)\n",

    "\n",
    "From this definition, we can see that $A \\subseteq cl(A)$, $cl(A)$ is a\n",
    "closed set, and that $A=cl(A)$ iff $A$ is a closed set.\n",

    "> **Interior**. The interior of a set $A$, denoted $int(A)$ is the set of all points\n",

    "## Functions in higher dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will often work with functions that map many variables (a vector) to\n",

    "## Partial derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial derivatives allow taking derivatives of a scalar field with\n",
    "respect to certain individual arguments. The *partial derivative* of $f$\n",
    "with respect to its argument $x_i$ at the values\n",
    "$(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$ is given by\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_i+h,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n)-f(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)}{h}$$\n",
    "In other words, this is the deriative in the direction of the $a_i$\n",
    "while fixing all of the other $a_j$'s, $i\\neq j$, constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this definition more compactly in vector notation:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(\\textbf{a}) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(\\textbf{a}+h\\textbf{e}_{i})-f(\\textbf{a})}{h}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A third possible interpretation is that we are taking the derivative of\n",
    "the function $$g_i(x) = f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},x,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n)$$ at\n",
    "$x = a_i$. In other words,\n",
    "$g_i^\\prime(x)|_{x = a_i} =\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(\\textbf{a})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that some other texts may use the notation $f_i$ to denote the\n",
    "partial derivative with respect to the $i$'th argument to $f$. I find this\n",
    "notation to be extremely confusing so we will use the\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}$ notation throughout this class.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Partial differentiation operator**. The notation $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ refers to the partial\n",

    "\n",
    "For shorthand, we may occasionally write $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing partial derivatives\n",
    "The rules for computing regular derivatives can also be applied when\n",
    "computing partial derivatives. The only difference is that *all\n",
    "arguments, except for the one being differentiated, are treated as\n",
    "constants*. As an exmaple, consider $$f(x_1,x_2) = x_1^k e^{c x_2}.$$\n",

    "because $x_1$ is treated as a constant.\n",

    "Be careful when a variable appears in multiple arguments. For example,\n",
    "given a function $f(x,g(x))$, the partial derivative of $f$ with respect\n",
    "to $x_1$ does *not* use the partial derivative with respect to $x_2$, or\n",
    "the derivative of $g$ in its calculation. Instead, you should treat the\n",
    "second argument as a constant $y$ and proceed as though it has no\n",
    "dependence on $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You *should* incorporate those derivatives when computing the *total\n",
    "derivative* with respect to $x$, which is denoted $\\frac{d}{dx}$ or\n",
    "$\\cdot^\\prime$. The total derivative treats the expression as a single\n",
    "function, $h(x) = f(x,g(x))$, and involves a chain rule with both\n",
    "partial derivatives:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dx}f(x,g(x)) = h^\\prime(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} f(x,g(x)) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} f(x,g(x)) g(x)^\\prime.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directional derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "The *directional derivative* is another type of derivative that measures\n",
    "the rate of change of the scalar field $f$ as you move from $\\textbf{a}$ in a\n",

    "### Gradient\n",
    "A fundamental result in multivariate calculus is that *all directional\n",

    "\n",
    "First, scaling: $$\\begin{split}\n",
