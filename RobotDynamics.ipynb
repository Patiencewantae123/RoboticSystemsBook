    "$c_1^L, c_2^L$ and local inertias $H_1, H_2$. Since this is a planar\n",
    "problem, inertias are simply scalars. The two coordinates are\n",
    "$q=(\\theta,r)$ where $\\theta$ is the CCW rotation of the first link\n",
    "relative to the $x$ axis, and $r$ gives the extent of the $P$\n",
    "manipulator along its local $x$ axis. Let us assume for simplicity that\n",
    "$c_2^L = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Via forward kinematics, the world-space coordinates of each center of\n",

    "### Effective inertia \n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications we may wish to convert between joint space dynamics\n",
    "and workspace dynamics. This concept of effective inertial lets us\n",
    "answer questions like or \"How much force would the robot apply to an\n",
    "object at point $p$?\" or \"How much external force is needed to\n",
    "accelerate a point $p$ on the robot at a given rate?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that without any external force, at the robot's current\n",
    "state $(q,\\dot{q})$ and external torques $u_0$ generates\n",
    "accelerations $\\ddot{q}_{0}$:\n",
    "$$\\ddot{q}_0 = B^{-1}(q)( u_{0} - C(q,\\dot{q}) - G(q))$$ We now wish to\n",
    "calculate what accelerations $\\ddot{q}$ would occur a force $f$ were\n",
    "applied at this point in time at point $p$. Supposing $J(q)$ is the\n",
    "Jacobian of $p$, the external torques become $u = u_0  + J^T(q)f$.\n",
    "Hence, we see that:\n",
    "$$\\ddot{q} = B^{-1}(q)( u - C(q,\\dot{q}) - G(q)) = B^{-1}(q)( u_0 + J^T(q)f - C(q,\\dot{q}) - G(q)) = B^{-1}(q)J^T(q)f + \\ddot{q}_0$$\n",
    "Hence, the change in joint accelerations $\\ddot{q}-\\ddot{q}_0$ caused by\n",
    "the force is $B^{-1}(q)J^T(q)f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we may wish to ask what the change in the *point's* acceleration\n",
    "is. Via the Jacobian, we have $$\\dot{p} = J(q)\\dot{q}$$ giving\n",
    "$$\\ddot{p} = \\dot{J}(q)\\dot{q} + J(q)\\ddot{q}.$$ Compared to the\n",
    "un-forced acceleration of $p$\n",
    "$$\\ddot{p}_0 = \\dot{J}(q)\\dot{q} + J(q)\\ddot{q}_0$$ we have\n",
    "$$\\ddot{p} - \\ddot{p}_0 = J(q)\\ddot{q} - J(q)\\ddot{q}_0 = J(q)B^{-1}(q)J^T(q)f.$$\n",
    "Another way of saying this, which matches the form of Newton's second law\n",
    "$f=ma$, is $$f = (J(q)B^{-1}(q)J^T(q))^{-1}(\\ddot{p} - \\ddot{p}_0).$$\n",
    "Hence, the matrix $(J(q)B^{-1}(q)J^T(q))^{-1}$ is known as the\n",
    "*effective inertia matrix* at point $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike mass matrices, the effective inertia can actually be infinite\n",
    "when the robot is at a singularity. Although $B^{-1}$ is always full\n",
    "rank, singularities in $J$ may cause $J(q)B^{-1}(q)J^T(q)$ to drop rank,\n",
    "making it non-invertible. The ultimate effect is that in some\n",
    "directions, there may be no force that can accelerate the robot.\n",
    "Similarly, if the manipulability of the Jacobian is small, a huge force\n",
    "may be needed to cause a small acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases this can be dangerous, such as when robots handle delicate\n",
    "objects or are supposed to be human-safe. Like a nutcracker, large\n",
    "forces can be exerted at pinch points near the robot's joints. This can\n",
    "be observed in the effective inertia matrix, since its entries grow\n",
    "larger as $p$ approaches a joint fixed to the world. In other cases,\n",
    "large effective inertia can be exploited, such as when a robot must\n",
    "handle a heavy load. Indeed, humans exploit large effective inertia\n",
    "while walking, keeping knees straight to avoid additional exertion.\n",
    "Similarly, when hanging by the hands or lifting large objects, it is\n",
    "more energetically efficient to keep the elbows straight.\n",
