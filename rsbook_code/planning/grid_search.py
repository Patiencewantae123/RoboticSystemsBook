    Args:
        xstart (array-like): start config
        xgoal (array-like or function g(x)): goal config, or goal test.
        xmin (array-like): grid minimum
        xmax (array-like): grid maximum
        obstacle_test (function f(x)): returns True if x is in an obstacle.
        obstacle_edge_test (function f(x,y), optional): returns True if the
            edge x->y hits an obstacle.  Default ignores edge collisions.
        resolution (float, optional): the resolution of the grid. Default is 1%
            of the max difference between xmin and xmax.
        diagonals (bool, optional): set to False to stay precisely on the grid.
        cost (function c(x,y), optional): returns the movement cost from x
            to y.
        terminal_cost (function cT(x), optional): returns the cost of
            terminating at x.
        implicit (bool, optional): if True, will use implicit search. 
            Otherwise, will construct the entire graph (False is used mostly
            for testing).

    Returns:
        tuple: a triple (path,distances,predecessors) giving
            - path (list of states or None): the configuration-space path.
