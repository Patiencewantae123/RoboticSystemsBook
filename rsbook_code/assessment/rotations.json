Axis-angle representation is <ul><li>usually more intuitive to specify, <li>has fewer parameters (4), <li>it is easier to test whether a given 4 parameters are a valid representation (simply check if the axis is a unit vector), and <li>the domain of valid parameters is simpler to express.</ul>  (Both representations are fairly easy to invert.)"
