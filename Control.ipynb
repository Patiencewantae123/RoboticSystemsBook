    "Control philosophies\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many techniques available for controlling a dynamic system.\n",
    "The philosophical approaches behind these techniques can be roughly\n",
    "categorized along three axes: prescriptive/descriptive, model free/model\n",
    "based, and myoptic/predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive vs prescriptive\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive approaches assume that a controller has been given, and the\n",
    "goal is to *analyze* whether the controlled system satisfies some\n",
    "desired properties. Examples of such properties could be stability,\n",
    "disturbance rejection, or some other performance metric. Empirical\n",
    "testing could involve simply simulating or running the system under many\n",
    "operational conditions and observing the results, but the more\n",
    "sophisticated techniques described below provide stronger guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive approaches, on the other hand, attempt to *synthesize* a\n",
    "control function given some desired properties. In general synthesis is\n",
    "more difficult than analysis, because any method with performance\n",
    "guarantees on the synthesized controller will also suppose to be able to\n",
    "quantitatively describe the level of performance achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-free vs model-based\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-free controllers exhibit operate under no assumptions about the\n",
    "form of $f(x,u)$, besides perhaps general notions of the directions of\n",
    "certain effects, e.g., increasing $u_1$ will result in a general\n",
    "increase in $x_1$. These controllers exhibit some degree of\n",
    "functionality regardless of how accurately the dynamics function has\n",
    "been determined and are hence easier to apply at first glance to a\n",
    "poorly characterized system. The use of *feedback* is essential to guide\n",
    "the state toward a desired point. Usually, they are also less\n",
    "computationally expensive and are almost certainly myopic rather than\n",
    "predictive. However, they typically require extensive tuning to achieve\n",
    "desired levels of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple example is a standard thermostat, which operates under the\n",
    "assumption that turning on the heat will increase the temperature of a\n",
    "room, and turning on air conditioning will decrease temperature. It is\n",
    "not necessary to know the exact rate at which heating / cooling affects\n",
    "temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based controllers by contrast use a mathematical or computational\n",
    "model of $f(x,u)$ in order to output the control $u$. These methods can\n",
    "largely attain superior performance than model-free approaches, but at\n",
    "greater difficulty at identifying a model of $f$, and greater\n",
    "computational expense. An example would be an advanced thermostat which\n",
    "measures internal and external temperatures and regulates the rate of\n",
    "heating / cooling to minimize energy consumption, e.g., not heating the\n",
    "room when the external temperature is higher than desired. At an\n",
    "extreme, a *feedforward*, open-loop controller simply calculates a\n",
    "trajectory of controls $u(t)$ and executes them without the use of state\n",
    "feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Myoptic vs predictive\n",
    "\n",
    "Myoptic (aka greedy) methods reason about controls only looking at a\n",
    "single instant in time. At most, a myopic method will examine the\n",
    "direction of motion in state space after the control is chosen at the\n",
    "current point in time. The time evolution of the system into the future\n",
    "is not explicitly considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive methods attempt to extrapolate the current state into the\n",
    "future under some hypothesized controls. As a result they must have a\n",
    "model of the dynamics in order to simulate potential solution\n",
    "trajectories. Predictive methods are also typically more computationally\n",
    "expensive than myopic methods, but can obtain much better performance.\n",
    "Usually, these methods have a reconfigurable parameter called the\n",
    "*horizon*, which specifies the duration of time into the future for\n",

    "### Applying PID to coupled systems\n",
    "\n",
    "An industrial robot can be considered as a $n$-D second order dynamical\n",
    "system with an $n$-D control, one for each joints. We can observe that\n",
    "each element of the control is aligned with the corresponding element of\n",
    "the state, which means that it could be possible to apply a PID\n",
    "controller separately for each joint. This is not a bad approach for\n",
    "stiff, highly-geared industrial robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we have seen in the prior chapter, each movement of a joint\n",
    "has inertial effects on the other joints. This is known as *coupling* in\n",
    "the dynamics. Due to this coupling, robot arms with softer PID gains\n",
    "may end up performing unstable or even chaotic motion with this\n",
    "approach, and the robot will not necessarily track paths in an optimal\n",
    "way. The PID approach may also perform quite poorly for vehicles when\n",
    "the disturbance from the setpoint is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the simple coupled LTI system described in\n",
    "[Fig. 4](#fig:PIDCoupled), with the initial error $(1,0)$. If the\n",
    "system were decoupled, the controller for $u_1$ would certainly dampen\n",
    "out the error. But due to coupling in the system, the error in $x_2$\n",
    "starts to increase, which starts to also increase the negative velocity\n",
    "in $x_1$, and so on. When $k_D=2$, the controller dampens out the error\n",
    "quickly, only overshooting once. When $k_D=1$, the controller spirals\n",
    "around the origin multiple times but is ultimately stable. When\n",
    "$k_D=0.5$, the controller ends up in an unstable trajectory.\n",

    "First we shall describe methods for analyzing the stability of a dynamic\n",
    "system under a given closed loop control. The most well-understood\n",
    "methods for doing so are in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, in\n",
    "which solution trajectories can be calculated analytically. In nonlinear\n",

    "analyzing stability are usually restricted to the local neighborhood of\n",

    "\n",
    "### Stability in Linear Time Invariant systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that LTI systems are given by equations of the form\n",
    "$$\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu$$ where $A$ and $B$ are constant matrices of size\n",
    "$n \\times n$ and $n \\times m$, respectively. We shall consider stability\n",

    "smooth nonlinear control function $u(x)$ can be approximated by its\n",
    "Taylor series at $x=0$, leading to an expression of the form\n",
    "$u(x) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}x + O(\\|x\\|^2)$. In this case,\n",
    "$K$ is the negative of its Jacobian. Hence, the results derived here\n",
    "will apply approximately in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be clear at first glance, but this class of controller\n",
    "actually *subsumes* PID control! To observe this, for any given\n",
    "second-order single-input single-output system\n",
    "$\\ddot{x} = ax+b\\dot{x}+cu$ we build an equivalent 1-input 3-output\n",

    "expression in parentheses oscillates at frequency $b$ and has magnitude\n",

    "that if $a > 0$, then the basis function is unstable. If $a = 0$, then\n",
    "the basis function oscillates forever. If $a < 0$, then the basis\n",
    "function decays to 0, and moreover the more negative $a$ is, the faster\n",
    "the decay. As a result, we can state the following principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A control $u=-Ku$ of an LTI system is convergent if all poles of $A-BK$\n",
    "have negative real component; is stable if all poles have non-positive\n",
    "real component; and is unstable if any pole has positive real\n",
    "component.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, it is customary to plot the poles of an LTI system as\n",
    "points on the complex plane. Verifying that the system is stable is a\n",
    "matter of checking whether the poles lie on the left half of the complex\n",
    "plane. The speed of convergence is also dictated by the distance from\n",
    "the vertical axis. It is also simple to visually inspect the oscillatory\n",
    "behavior of solutions by examining their imaginary components: as the\n",
    "imaginary magnitude increases, so does the frequency of oscillation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the question of complex eigenvalues, it can be shown that\n",
    "for all complex eigenvalues $\\lambda_k = a_k + i b_k$, another\n",
    "eigenvalue will be the *complex conjugate* $\\lambda_j = a_k - i b_k$\n",
    "formed by negating all of the imaginary components. Moreover, if $v_k$\n",
    "is the eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_k$, the eigenvector $v_j$\n",
    "corresponding to $\\lambda_j$ will be defined with entries equal to the\n",
    "complex conjugate of every entry of $v_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that both the real parts and the imaginary parts of these\n",
    "solutions are real-valued solutions to the original ODE. If\n",
    "$$x(t) = Re(x(t)) + i\\cdot Im(x(t))$$ is a complex solution trajectory\n",
    "then\n",
    "$$Re(\\dot{x}(t)) + i\\cdot Im(\\dot{x}(t)) = \\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) = A\\cdot Re(x(t)) + i A\\cdot Im(x(t)).$$\n",
    "Since $A$ is real, both the real and imaginary terms must match between\n",
    "the left and right hand sides of the equation. That is,\n",
    "$Re(\\dot{x}(t)) = A\\cdot Re(x(t))$ and\n",
    "$Im(\\dot{x}(t)) = A\\cdot Im(x(t))$. As a result, if we find complex\n",

    "Note that LTI systems with a drift term $$\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu + c,$$ with\n",

    "These systems may be stable, but will not be convergent with a control\n",
    "of the form $u=-Kx$ because the $n+1$'th dimension has an eigenvalue\n",

    "converge, and the best that can be hoped for is convergence to a\n",
    "periodic trajectory (called an orbit, discussed briefly below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stability in nonlinear systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the LTI case, stability analysis for nonlinear systems is largely\n",
    "limited to a neighborhood of the equilibrium point. In other words, we\n",
    "can only hope to prove stability / convergence locally; once the state\n",
    "is disturbed out of that neighborhood no stability guarantees can be\n",
    "made.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linearization\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest method for examining the stability of a nonlinear system is\n",
    "to linearize the system about the equilibrium point and apply standard\n",
    "LTI control theory. This approach can be effective for some systems, but\n",
    "due to the use of linearization, it assumes second order effects are\n",
    "negligible. As a result it is only approximate and the approximation\n",
    "worsens as the state deviates from the equilibrium point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general method linearizes about the 0 state and the 0 control to\n",
    "determine an LTI system as follows:\n",
    "$$A = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(0,0)$$\n",
    "$$B = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u}(0,0).$$ If the system has drift,\n",
    "$f(0,0) \\neq 0$, then a drift vector must also be included in the LTI\n",
    "model $$c = f(0,0).$$ Given a gain matrix $K$, the LTI stability methods\n",
    "above can then be used to determine stability of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, oftentimes the approximation errors introduced by linearization\n",
    "are so severe that this method fails to verify that a control is stable\n",
    "/ convergent. As an example, consider the 1D system: $$\\dot{x} = xu.$$\n",
    "The linearization has the $A$ and $B$ matrices identically 0, hence the\n",
    "pole is at 0 and the LTI analysis determines the system to be stable but\n",
    "not convergent. However, if we set $u = -x$, we see that\n",
    "$\\dot{x} = -x^2$ which has the analytical solution $x(t) = 1/(t+C)$.\n",
    "Obviously this converges to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lyapunov stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Lyapunov's method is the most commonly used method for directly studying\n",
    "the stability of nonlinear systems. The main difficulty of nonlinear\n",
    "systems is that it is challenging to determine a closed-form expression\n",
    "for trajectories given an initial state. The idea behind this method is\n",
    "to prove the existence of a function that 1) is minimal at the\n",
    "equilibrium point, and 2) via the dynamics of the system its value will\n",
    "be monotonically decreasing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us suppose a closed-loop control $u(x)$ is given. We can then\n",
    "rewrite the dynamics of the system only in terms of $x$ as\n",
    "$\\dot{x} = g(x) \\equiv f(x,u(x))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, suppose we are given a *Lyapunov function*\n",
    "$V(x):\\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with the following\n",
    "properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $V(0) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $V(x) > 0$ for $x \\neq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then examine how the value of the Lyapunov function behaves over\n",
    "time. Taking the time derivative $\\frac{d}{dt} V(x(t))$, we get the\n",
    "relation\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt} V(x) = \\frac{\\partial V(x)}{\\partial x} \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial V(x)}{\\partial x} g(x).$$\n",
    "Now if we can prove that $\\frac{\\partial V(x)}{\\partial x} g(x) \\leq 0$\n",
    "for all $x$ in the neighborhood of the origin $\\|x\\| \\leq \\delta$, then\n",
    "the system is *Lyapunov stable*. Intuitively, for any starting state in\n",
    "the $\\delta$-neighborhood of the equilibrium point, $V$ stays bounded,\n",
    "and hence the system state cannot stray too far from the equilibrium\n",
    "point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the inequality is replaced by a strict inequality\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial V(x)}{\\partial x} g(x) < 0$ for all $x$ in the\n",
    "neighborhood $0 < \\| x \\| \\leq \\delta$, then the system is convergent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lyapunov function can be considered to act as a sort of energy\n",
    "function that is minimized at equilibrium. Since energy is never added\n",
    "over time, the system will return to an equilibrium state. This often\n",
    "implies that to design a Lyapunov function it suffices to calculate the\n",
    "total energy of the system (kinetic + potential energy). In general, the\n",
    "design of a suitable Lyapunov function for a given dynamic system is\n",
    "somewhat of an art.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Orbits and Poincaré maps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of systems with drift, in which drift cannot be cancelled\n",
    "out by choosing a suitable control, convergence to an equilibrium point\n",
    "is impossible. Examples of such systems include fixed-wing aircraft and\n",
    "bipedal walking. However, it may be possible to define a cyclic\n",
    "trajectory with favorable behavior, toward which all other trajectories\n",
    "converge (at least, when the starting point is sufficiently close to the\n",
    "trajectory).\n",
    "\n",
    "A trajectory that returns to a previously encountered state $x(0)$ will\n",
    "cycle forever. Such a trajectory is known as periodic. An example would\n",
    "be a bipedal walking gait in which the same configurations and\n",
    "velocities are reached repeatedly after every two steps. Another would\n",
    "be a holding pattern in which an aircraft can repeat an unlimited number\n",
    "of times (or at least, until fuel runs out).\n",
    "\n",
    "The image\n",
    "$\\{ x \\quad |\\quad x=x(t)\\text{ for some }t\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ of a\n",
    "periodic trajectory $x(t)$ is known as an *orbit*. A stable orbit is an\n",
    "orbit such that for all starting points in a neighborhood of the orbit,\n",
    "the resulting trajectory never deviates too far from the orbit. An orbit\n",
    "is convergent if for all starting states in a neighborhood of the orbit,\n",
    "the resulting trajectory converges toward the orbit. A convergent orbit\n",
    "in 2D is known as a *limit cycle*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Poincaré map is method for studying the convergence of periodic\n",
    "trajectories, typically via simulation. The idea is to define an $n-1$-D\n",
    "region in state space (the Poincaré section) through which each\n",
    "trajectory passes through once per cycle. The points at which the\n",
    "trajectory passes through the section form a sequence of discrete states\n",
    "$x_1,x_2,x_3,...$. If those states converge to a fixed point, then the\n",
    "trajectory can be concluded to be stable. Often it is not possible to\n",
    "determine the sequence of states analytically, and hence this technique\n",
    "is most often applied with numerical simulation.\n",
