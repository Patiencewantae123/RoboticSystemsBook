    "\n",
    "Let us start with a running example where a point $P$ is drawn on a\n",
    "sheet of graph paper $G$. Some physical position is taken as the\n",
    "origin $O$ by convention, as are the axes $X$ and $Y$ which are attached\n",
    "to the graph paper. If we were to draw the straight line from $O$ to\n",
    "$P$, suppose the movement of the pen moves $p_x$ units in the $X$\n",
    "direction and $p_y$ units in the $Y$ direction. If we were to move the\n",
    "paper (say, a few inches to the left and rotated 25$^\\circ$), those dots\n",
    "have all moved in physical space, but since they were attached to the\n",

    "we would simply need to find the new physical location of position $P$\n",

    "### Associating physical meaning to operations on coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "The main distinction between positions and directions is that the choice\n",
    "of origin does not affect how directions are represented. However, both\n",
    "are affected by the choice of coordinate axes. Hence, when performing\n",
    "changes of coordinates, the interpretation of position quantities\n",
    "changes in a different manner from that of directional quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positions and directional quantities also transform *into each other*\n",
    "when various operations are performed on them. When two positions are\n",
    "differenced, a displacement is produced. When a displacement is added to\n",
    "a position, another position is obtained. Displacements can be added to\n",
    "other displacements, or multiplied a scalar. However, it is meaningless\n",
    "to multiply a position by a scalar, or to add two position together,\n",
    "*even though these are valid vector operations on their\n",
    "representations*. (In cases where these latter two operations would seem\n",
    "to make sense, it is more appropriate to talk about displacements with\n",
    "respect to some other position.) Directions transform in much the same\n",
    "way that displacements do, but they do not scale or add.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the following mathematical operations on coordinates\n",
    "correspond to meaningful physical operations. The output of these\n",

    "### Working with coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with different coordinate representations, it is easy to\n",
    "make mistakes in calculations. Below are some common pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistaken coordinate conventions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Assuming coordinates are given in a different frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Incorrectly assuming a matrix represents its inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Incorrectly assuming a matrix represents its transpose (row-major vs\n",
    "    column-major).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Assuming a coordinate frame is represented with respect to an\n",
    "    incorrect base frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Applying a coordinate transform to a quantity not represented with\n",
    "    respect to the source frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "To guard against these mistakes, it is common practice to indicate\n",
    "frames of reference with letters and annotate variables with their frame\n",
    "of reference. As an example, this book indicates the frame of reference\n",
    "of each coordinate variable in its subscript, e.g. $\\V{p}_A$ denotes a\n",
    "point expressed in frame $A$. A coordinate transform from frame\n",
    "$A \\rightarrow B$ is expressed in the form $T_{A\\rightarrow B}$. By\n",
    "convention, a coordinate transform $T_A$ is equivalent to a transform\n",
    "from $A$ to the world frame $W$: $T_A \\equiv T_{A \\rightarrow W}$. With\n",
    "this annotation, the following rules apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When applying a transform to a coordinate, the subscript of the\n",
    "    transform's source frame must match the point's reference frame. For\n",
    "    example, $\\V{p}_B = T_{A\\rightarrow B}\\V{p}_A$ is allowed but\n",
    "    $T_{B\\rightarrow A}\\V{p}_A$ is illegal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  When composing two transforms, the source frame of the second frame\n",
    "    must match the destination of the first frame. For example,\n",
    "    $T_{A\\rightarrow C} = T_{B \\rightarrow C} T_{A\\rightarrow B}$ is\n",
    "    allowed but $T_{A\\rightarrow B} T_{B \\rightarrow C}$ is illegal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  When inverting a transform, the order of frames swaps: e.g.\n",
    "    $T_{A\\rightarrow B}^{-1} = T_{B\\rightarrow A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular annotation used by some authors is a\n",
    "superscript/subscript notation, in which the reference frame of a\n",
    "coordinate and the destination frame of a transform are indicated as a\n",
    "superscript, while the source frame of a transform is indicated as a\n",
    "subscript. For example, $\\V{p}^B = T_A^{B}\\V{p}^A$ expresses the\n",
    "coordinate transform of point $\\V{p}$ from frame $A$ to $B$, and\n",
    "$T_A^C = T_B^C T_A^B$ expresses the composition of two coordinate\n",
    "transforms. In this convention, superscripts and subscripts must cancel\n",
    "out for the equation to make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix expressions are similar to standard expressions regarding real\n",
    "numbers in that addition and subtraction are equivalent, multiplication\n",
    "is nearly equivalent, and inverses give an approximation of division.\n",
    "But, this similarity leads to common pitfalls when manipulating matrix\n",
    "equations. Here are some common mistakes that should be safeguarded\n",
    "against:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Performing transformations out of order, or swapping the arguments\n",
    "    of a matrix product (products are not associative).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Propagating transposes or inverses into a matrix product without\n",
    "    swapping the order of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Assuming that a matrix is invertible (or worse, assuming a\n",
    "    non-square matrix is invertible).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Performing operations on matrices of incompatible size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate management\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential when working with coordinates to understand 1) which\n",
    "coordinate frame is being used, 2) what unit is being used for\n",
    "measurement, and 3) do the coordinates represent a position or\n",
    "directional quantity? Failure to do so is a frequent source of errors.\n",
    "When we begin discussing forward kinematics, this requires substantial\n",
    "bookkeeping and notation. Moreover, in a production robot, dozens or\n",
    "hundreds of coordinate conventions may be used.\n",

    "***************\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, some middleware systems come with coordinate management\n",
    "systems. These systems attach an annotation to a coordinate, so that\n",
    "each position or directional quantity consists of a vector $\\V{p}$\n",
    "stored alongside its annotation $A_p$. The annotation may include\n",
    "whether the quantity is positional or directional, as well as an\n",
    "identifier of its coordinate frame. The system will also store a\n",
    "list of coordinate frames, represented in coordinates relative to some\n",
    "privileged frame (usually called the \"world frame\"). Such systems will\n",
    "allow users to query the coordinates of points and directions in\n",
    "arbitrary frames, and to calculate coordinate transformation matrices.\n",
    "With these systems, it becomes somewhat more convenient to maintain and\n",
    "manipulate a large number of quantities and reference frames. Examples\n",
    "include the `tf` module in ROS\n",
