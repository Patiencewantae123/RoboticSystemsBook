    "\n",
    "When working with different coordinate representations, it is easy to\n",
    "make mistakes in calculations. Below are some common pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistaken coordinate conventions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Assuming coordinates are given in a different frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Incorrectly assuming a matrix represents its inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Incorrectly assuming a matrix represents its transpose (row-major vs\n",
    "    column-major).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Assuming a coordinate frame is represented with respect to an\n",
    "    incorrect base frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Applying a coordinate transform to a quantity not represented with\n",
    "    respect to the source frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Operating on the wrong units (e.g., a frame's translation is expressed in *m* while the point's coordinates are expressed in *mm*)\n",
    "\n",
    "To guard against these mistakes, it is common practice to indicate\n",
    "frames of reference with letters and annotate variables with their frame\n",
    "of reference.  The superscript/subscript convention used by this book is\n",
    "popular amongst many authors.  In this convention, we indicate the frame\n",
    "of reference of each coordinate variable in its superscript, e.g. $\\mathbf{p}^A$ denotes a\n",
    "point expressed in frame $A$. A coordinate transform from frame\n",
    "$A$ to frame $B$ is expressed in the form $T_A^B$.  Think about it\n",
    "this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $F$ in *superscript*: Coordinates should be interpreted as \"relative to $F$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> $F$ in *subscript*: Coordinates should be interpreted as \"describing the transform of frame $F$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this convention, *superscripts and subscripts must cancel\n",
    "out for the equation to make sense*.  Specifically, the following rules apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When applying a transform to a coordinate, the subscript of the\n",
    "    transform's source frame must match the point's superscript (reference\n",
    "    frame). For example, $\\mathbf{p}^B = T_A^B\\mathbf{p}^A$ is allowed but\n",
    "    $T_B^A \\mathbf{p}_B$ is illegal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  When composing two transforms, the source frame of the second frame\n",
    "    must match the destination of the first frame. For example,\n",
    "    $T_A^C = T_B^C T_A^B$ is\n",
    "    allowed but $T_A^B T_B^C$ is illegal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  When inverting a transform, the order of frames swaps: e.g.\n",
    "    $(T_A^B)^{-1} = T_B^A$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4.  When adding or subtracting coordinates, their superscripts must match!\n",
    "    For example, $\\mathbf{a}^W - \\mathbf{b}^W$ is the displacement between\n",
    "    two points expressed in the world frame, but $\\mathbf{a}^W - \\mathbf{b}^C$\n",
    "    is an illegal operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, a coordinate without a superscript is assumed to be associated\n",
    "with the world frame $W$: $\\mathbf{p} \\equiv \\mathbf{p}^W$.  Moreover,a\n",
    "coordinate transform $T_A$ is equivalent to a transform\n",
    "from $A$ to $W$: $T_A \\equiv T_A^W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix expressions are similar to standard expressions regarding real\n",
    "numbers in that addition and subtraction are equivalent, multiplication\n",
    "is nearly equivalent, and inverses give an approximation of division.\n",
    "But, this similarity leads to common pitfalls when manipulating matrix\n",
    "equations. Here are some common mistakes that should be safeguarded\n",
    "against:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Performing transformations out of order, or swapping the arguments\n",
    "    of a matrix product (products are not commutative).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Propagating transposes or inverses into a matrix product without\n",
    "    swapping the order of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Assuming that a matrix is invertible (or worse, assuming a\n",
